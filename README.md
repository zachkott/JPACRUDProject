# JPACRUDProject

## Description
For our week 9 project we were tasked with building our first full stack web application. For this project we were allowed to choose our own topic, and I chose cannabis as my enitity. The first feature that I added to this application allows the user to search for any strain using its unique Id number. If the user enters a valid Id, they will be brought to a page displays the entire bud profile as well as options to delete a bud from the database, and update bud's information. This application also allows the user to add their  own bud to the database with the same options to update and delete. Every page has a nav bar at the top that allows the user to navigate to 4 different pages. The user can return to the home page by simply clicking on the home button. The user can also navigate to the Add Bud page by clicking on the Add Bud button. Additionally the user can click the Show All button if they wish to view all of the bud's that are currently in the database.

## Technologies Used
Java, Spring boot, SQL, MySQL, JDBC, CSS, Gradle, Git, HTML, BootStrap, JPA, Apache Tomcat, AWS, Atom, Terminal

## Challenges/Lessons Learned
My biggest challenge with this project was writing my controller methods and making sure all of my jsp's had the correct action name. There were several instances where my links were leading to nothing and I would get 500 errors. However, after several hours of trial and error and debugging I finally had a moment where everything clicked. Additionally, this was my first real attempt at any styling, so I had a little trouble using BootStrap and stylesheets initially. I also learned the importance of using JUnit tests, as well as using sysouts to track the path of all of the different CRUD operations, this saved me a lot of time when it came to debugging.
